Abstract The superfamily Conoidea is one of the most speciose groups of marine mollusks, with estimates of about 340 recent valid genera and subgenera, and 4000 named living species. Previous classiﬁcations were based on shell and anatomical characters, and clades and phylogenetic relationships are far from well assessed. Based on a dataset of ca. 100 terminal taxa belonging to 57 genera, information provided by fragments of one mitochondrial (COI) and three nuclear (28S, 18S and H3) genes is used to infer the ﬁrst molecular phylogeny of this group. Analyses are performed on each gene independently as well as for a data matrix where all genes are concatenated, using Maximum Likelihood, Maximum Parsimony and Bayesian approaches. Several well-supported clades are deﬁned and are only partly identiﬁable to currently recognized families and subfamilies. The nested sampling used in our study allows a discussion of the classiﬁcation at various taxonomical levels, and several genera, subfamilies and families are found polyphyletic. Ó 2007 Elsevier Inc.

1. Introduction The superfamily Conoidea (= Toxoglossa) includes small to medium (3–50 mm on average) sized species of marine snails that are specialist predators on annelids, other mollusks, and even ﬁshes, and occupy all marine habitats from the tropics to the poles, from shallow to deep water, and from hard to soft substrates. This is the most diverse groups of marine mollusks, with almost 700 recent

and fossil nominal genera and 10,000 described species (Bouchet, 1990), and current estimates of about 340 recent valid genera and subgenera (Taylor et al., 1993) and 4000 named living species (Tucker, 2004). Conus alone includes over 500 valid species, making it the most speciose genus of marine animals (Kohn, 1990; Duda and Kohn, 2005). The monophyly of the Conoidea, characterized by a venom apparatus, is not questioned (Taylor et al., 1993), but subdivisions within Conoidea, and relationships between them are controversial, mostly because the extensive morphological and anatomical variation encountered is itself not well understood. In this context, molecular data can bring new characters, allowing to root the classiﬁcation of Conoidea in an evolutionary perspective using a phylogenetic analysis.

During most of the 19th and 20th century, classiﬁcations (e.g., Fischer, 1887; Cossmann, 1896; Hedley, 1922; Thiele, 1929; Wenz, 1938–1944) were based on characters of the shell and of the radula, and Powell (1942, 1966) later gave emphasis on characters of the protoconch (larval shell). All these authors traditionally recognized three families of recent Conoidea: (i) Conidae, only containing the genus Conus, (ii) Terebridae containing species with acuminate shells without a siphonal canal, and (iii) Turridae, including the rest, i.e., the vast majority of the group. Turridae was considered by Hedley (1922) to be ‘‘more perplexing than any other molluscan family”. Powell’s (1942, 1966) subdivision of the Turridae in nine subfamilies (see Table 1) was the basis for turrid classiﬁcations in the latter half of the 20th century. Subsequent authors diverged on the number of subfamilies they recognized, mostly splitting one subfamily into several: working mainly on East Paciﬁc faunas, McLean (1971) thus recognized 15 subfamilies of Turridae; Kilburn (various papers from 1983 to 1995) recognized eight subfamilies in the South African fauna; while in their monograph of European deep-sea turrids, Bouchet ´ and Waren (1980) criticized the use of ‘‘more or less randomly selected shell characters” and did not use subfamilies at all. Other shell- and radula-based classiﬁcations, mostly regional, include Morrison (1965), Shimek and Kohn (1981) and Chang (1995, 2001). A turning point in toxoglossate classiﬁcation was the work of Taylor et al. (1993) who extensively used anatomical characters, in addition to radulae. Their entirely novel classiﬁcation recognized six families (Conidae, Turridae, Terebridae, Drilliidae, Pseudomelatomidae and Strictispiridae), the salient point being that Conidae was by then enlarged beyond Coninae (Conus) to include ﬁve subfamilies previously placed in Turridae, and the newly restricted Turridae included a further ﬁve subfamilies. Bouchet and Rocroi’s (2005) recent review of gastropod classiﬁcation essentially kept Taylor’s classiﬁcation with updates based mainly on Rosenberg (1998) and Medinskaya and Sysoev (2003): Clavatulinae was raised to the family level; Taraninae was synonymized with Raphitominae; and the novel subfamily Zemaciinae was accepted in the Turridae. Thereafter, we use ‘‘Turridae s.l.” to designate all Conoidea except Conus and Terebridae (i.e., Turridae sensu Powell (1966) and most 20th century authors) and ‘‘Turridae s.s.” to designate the family as restricted by Taylor et al. (1993), while ‘‘Conidae” designates the expanded family after Taylor et al. (1993). Since Taylor et al. (1993), several anatomical studies have highlighted the high level of homoplasy of the characters of the shell and the radula (e.g., Kantor and Taylor, 1994; Kantor et al., 1997; Taylor, 1994), but although Conus itself has been subjected to intensive molecular studies (e.g., Duda and Kohn, 2005), the phylogeny of the broader Conoidea has not yet been addressed based on molecular characters. The present paper is thus the ﬁrst molecular phylogeny, based on fragments of one mitochondrial and three nuclear genes, of the crown clade of

the Caenogastropoda. It provides insights at several taxonomic levels (generic, subfamilial and familial) and the adequacy of previous classiﬁcations is thus re-evaluated. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Taxon sampling Because of the instability of the taxonomy of the group, currently accepted synonymies cannot be taken for certain and must be re-evaluated. Ideally, a molecular sampling should thus include several representatives of all the nominal family group-names, including their type genera, whether they are currently regarded as taxonomically valid or not. In practice, this goal is diﬃcult or impossible to reach because (a) a number of nominal (sub)families are based on fossil type genera (e.g., Borsoniinae, Conorbinae), and (b) a number of type genera are restricted in distribution and/or live in deep water and are diﬃcult to obtain alive (e.g., Pseudomelatomidae, Thatcheriidae). To overcome these diﬃculties, our taxon sampling includes several genera for as many as possible of the subfamilies proposed in the literature (see detail in Table 1). Of the 114 specimens sequenced, few were replicates and the taxon sampling represents about 100 species in 57 valid genera. 2.2. Materials The bulk of the material was obtained during expeditions carried out in the tropical western Paciﬁc during ´ research expeditions by the Museum National d’Histoire Naturelle (MNHN) and the Institut de Recherche pour le ´ Developpement (IRD) (see Table 2). Living specimens were anesthetized using MgCl2, a piece of tissue was cut from the head-foot, and ﬁxed in 95% ethanol. This dataset was supplemented by specimens collected in West Africa by Serge Gofas in the mid 1980s. Shells were kept intact for identiﬁcation. Identiﬁcations were carried to genus level using the classically admitted shell-based genus deﬁnitions, but, given the chaotic state of turrid systematics, no attempt was made to identify our material to species level; a number of species, especially from deep water, probably represent new species. Even so, eight specimens could not conﬁdently be attributed to a genus and are denoted thereafter ‘‘cf. Genus”. Conversely, specimens of Terebridae and Conus were identiﬁed to species level. A specimen of a species of Nassaria and a specimen of a species of Cancellopollia, both in the neogastropod family Buccinidae, closely related to Conoidea (Harasewych et al., 1997; Colgan et al., 2007), were used as outgroups. Littorina littorea, belonging in the non-neogastropod family Littorinidae, was used as a third outgroup, with sequences taken from GenBank (GenBank Accession Nos: AJ622946.1, Q279985.1, AJ488712.1 and DQ093507.1). Outgroups were chosen to form a non-monophyletic group, as recommended by Darlu and Tassy (1993). All vouchers are kept in MNHN.

2.3. Sequencing DNA was extracted from a piece of foot, using 6100 Nucleic Acid Prepstation system (Applied Biosystem) or DNeasyÒ 96 Tissue kit (Qiagen) for smaller specimens. A fragment of 658 bp of Cytochrome Oxidase I (COI) mitochondrial gene was ampliﬁed using the universal primers LCO1490 and HCO2198 developed by Folmer et al. (1994). Three nuclear gene fragments were also analyzed: (i) 900 bp of the rDNA 28S gene, involving D1, D2 and D3 domains (Hassouna et al., 1984), using the primers C1 and D3 (Jovelin and Justine, 2001); (ii) 328 bp of the H3 gene using the primers H3aF and H3aR (Okusu et al., 2003); (iii) 1770 bp of the 18S gene using three pairs of primers: 1F and 5R, 3F and Bi, A2 and 9R (Giribet et al., 1996; Okusu et al., 2003). All PCR reactions were performed in 25 ll, containing 3 ng of DNA, 1Â reaction buﬀer, 2.5 mM MgCl2, 0.26 mM dNTP, 0.3 lM of each primer, 5% DMSO and 1.5 U of Q-Bio Taq (Qbiogene) for all genes. Ampliﬁcations consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 40 , followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 3000 , annealing at 52 °C for 28S gene and ﬁrst and third fragment of 18S gene, and 53 °C for H3 gene and second fragment of 18S gene for 4000 and extension at 72 °C for 10 . The ﬁnal extension was at 72 °C for 100 . COI gene ampliﬁcations followed description of Hebert et al. (2003). PCR products were puriﬁed using ExonucleaseI and Phosphatase and sequenced using BigDyeTerminator V3.1 kit (Applied biosystem) and the ABI3730XL sequencer. Because of the length of the 28S PCR product, two internal primers (D2 and C20 , Dayrat et al., 2001) were used for sequencing, in addition of primers used for PCR. All genes were sequenced for both directions to conﬁrm accuracy of each sequence. The overlap of the three fragments of 18S gene made it possible to check for consistency. Sequences were deposited in GenBank (GenBank Accession Nos: EU015417–EU015858). 2.4. Phylogenetic analyses COI and H3 genes were manually aligned whereas 28S and 18S genes were automatically aligned using ClustalW multiple alignment implemented in BioEdit version 7.0.5.3 (Hall, 1999). The accuracy of automatic alignments was conﬁrmed by eye. Hyper-variable regions of 28S gene and 30 extremity of 18S gene were excluded from further analyses due to ambiguities in the alignments. For protein coding genes (COI and H3), saturation according to codon position was tested by plotting genetic distances against patristic distances calculated from a Maximum Parsimony (MP) tree with a heuristic search option, 10 random taxonaddition (RA) and tree-bisection and reconnection (TBR) branch-swapping using PAUP 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord, 2002). Nucleotide substitution models were selected for each gene separately and for each combined dataset using the program Modeltest (Posada and Crandall, 2001), in conjunction with PAUP 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord, 2002). Best models

and parameters as estimated by the AIC criterion were used for Maximum Likelihood (ML) analyses; only the model was ﬁxed for Bayesian Analyses (BA). Analyses were conducted using three diﬀerent approaches. A heuristic MP search was executed with 100 RA, TBR branchswapping, all sites equally weighted and indels treated as ﬁfth states, using PAUP 4.0b10 (Swoﬀord, 2002). ML heuristic search was conducted with 100 replicates with TBR branch-swapping using PhyML 2.4.4 (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003). Robustness of the nodes was assessed using nonparametric bootstrapping (Felsenstein, 1985) with 100 bootstraps replicates for MP analysis and 1000 for ML analysis, TBR branch-swapping and 100 RA replicates. BA consisted of six Markov chains (8,000,000 generations each with a sampling frequency of one tree each hundred generations) run in two parallel analyses using Mr. Bayes (Huelsenbeck et al., 2001). When the log-likelihood scores were found to stabilize, a consensus tree was calculated after omitting the ﬁrst 25% trees as burn-in. For the treatment of combined data using BA, the data were separated into four unlinked partitions corresponding to the four genes analyzed, each following the best ﬁtting model of substitution estimated for each gene. 2.5. Turning the phylogeny into a classiﬁcation There are currently 41 available family-group names in the Conoidea, of which 19 are considered valid at family or subfamily ranks (Bouchet and Rocroi, 2005). In a nomenclatural perspective, only the occurrence of the type genus of a family-group name in a clade allows an unequivocal application of this name to that clade. For example, the clade containing the genus Raphitoma can unambiguously carry the name Raphitominae. However, many type genera are not represented in our taxon sampling and many of our molecular clades do not include a type genus. In such cases, we have relied on the traditional allocation of non-type genera to a subfamily to link clade and name. For example, a clade containing three genera classically classiﬁed in the family Drilliidae (Taylor et al., 1993; Tippet and Tucker, 1995) can carry the name Drilliidae, even though Drillia itself is not part of our taxon sampling. However, this approach does not lead to an unequivocal application of names when genera (or subfamilies) as traditionally construed prove to be non-monophyletic; in that case, only the type species (or the type genus) is the legitimate bearer of the name. 3. Results For COI and H3 genes, 658 and 328 bp were sequenced, respectively, and no indels were found. After the alignment, we obtained a fragment of 933 and 1729 bp in length for the 28S and 18S genes, respectively. Sequencing of specimens belonging to genera Clavatula, Pusionella and Perrona was successful only for the COI gene: the prolonged conservation in the museum collections (more than 20 years) may have altered the quality of the DNA. Only

one specimen (17855) failed to sequence for COI gene, and three others (17842, 17919 and 17920, genus Cochlespira) for H3 gene. No bias was detected in base composition. The saturation analyses for the two protein coding genes revealed that the COI gene was highly saturated on the third position of codon, thus we used only the ﬁrst and second positions in the phylogenetic analyses. Best model and parameters estimated for each gene and genes combinations are shown in Table 3. Independent analyses of each of the four genes provided very poorly resolved trees, with few well-supported clades (Table 4). The only incongruencies found between the independent gene analyses corresponded to poorly supported nodes. The most supported incongruency concerned relationships between three specimens attributed to the genus Bathytoma (17700, 17865 and 17857). In the ML analysis of H3 gene 17700 was the sister-group of 17865 and 17857 whereas in the ML analysis of the 18S gene 17865 was the sister-group of 17700 and 17857. These two nodes were supported by bootstrap value of, respectively, 61 and 67, values weaker than the bootstrap value allowing the recognition of a supported clade (e.g., Hillis and Bull, 1993; Soltis and Soltis, 2003).

Since no incongruency was revealed among the single gene analyses, we constructed two combined datasets comprising the data of the 4 gene fragments resulting in a sequence of 3428 bp length. For both combined datasets we excluded the taxa attributed to Clavatula, Pusionella and Perrona for which only the COI gene was successfully obtained. For the ﬁrst combined dataset (CD1) we also excluded the specimens 17855, 17842, 17919 and 17920, not sequenced for all genes, to avoid potential perturbation of phylogenetic reconstruction by missing data (Wiens, 1998). Thus, the CD1 included 104 ingroups and the second combined dataset (CD2) included 108 ingroups. In CD2, missing sequences were treated as missing characters in all analyses. For CD1 and CD2, respectively, 662 and 671 sites were variable among which 454 and 460 were parsimony informative. The Conoidea were found monophyletic, at least with the two combined analyses, although not always strongly supported (for CD2, MP and ML bootstraps, respectively: 65 and 79, Posterior Probabilities PP: 1). Within the Conoidea, two clades could be distinguished: clade A (MP bootstraps: 58, ML bootstraps: 68, PP: 0.73) and clade B (MP bootstraps: 28, ML bootstraps: 52, PP: 1). Within the clade A, the clade C is found strongly supported with ML bootstraps (91) and PP (1). Each analysis of the two combined datasets allowed the deﬁnition of the same 21 higher level clades, each of them strongly supported: MP and ML bootstraps >80 and PP >0.99 (Mason-Gamer and Kellogg, 1996; Zander, 2004). They included from 1 to 12 genera each (Tables 4 and 5, Fig. 1). Clades were numbered according to their position in the tree (Fig. 1). Clades 1–9 are included in clade A, and among them clades 1–4 are included in clade C. Clades 10–21 are included in clade B. As long branches, for example that displayed by clade 9, could potentially disturb phylogenetic reconstructions (Felsenstein, 2004), the three analyses (MP, ML and BA) were conducted for the whole CD2, excluding specimens 17701 and 17702 (clade 9). The Conoidea were again separated in two clades: A0 (including clades 1–8) and B. The boostraps and PP were increased for both clades A0 (MP Bootstraps: 60, ML bootstraps: 77, PP: 1) and clade B (MP Bootstraps: 37, ML bootstraps: 60, PP: 1). The position of the representatives of Clavatula, Pusionella and Perrona, for which we obtained only the COI sequence, could be analyzed only in the single gene analysis. The taxa clustered in the weakly supported clade 22 in all the performed COI gene analyses (Table 4, tree not shown). The weak resolution of the trees obtained with the COI gene did not permit the placement of clade 22 in either clade A or B. All representatives of a genus clustered together in 1 of the 22 clades, except representatives of Borsonia, Comitas, Conus and Leucosyrinx. The representatives of Borsonia and Conus splitted, respectively, in clades 15, 16 and 19– 21, each including only specimens from a single genus. The relationships between the two clades were not resolved and thus the monophyly of each of these genera cannot be

rejected. Conversely, the monophyly of genera Leucosyrinx and Comitas (clades 3, 4 and 9) can be rejected, since representatives of the two genera clustered in the clade 4. 4. Discussion 4.1. Classiﬁcation of the Conoidea

dictor of generic allocations. Two further genera (Borsonia and Conus) are found to be diphyletic, but the position of the two deﬁned clades is unresolved and thus monophyly cannot be excluded. Similarly, the polyphyly of some genera within the clades 1–22 can not be conﬁrmed because of the lack of support for intra-clade nodes (results not shown). 4.3. Position of the genera within the subfamilies

Although not strongly supported, our analysis suggests that the superfamily Conoidea is monophyletic. However, the Conoidea and two outgroups used here (Cancellopollia and Nassaria) both belong in the Neogastropoda, the phylogeny of which is not well resolved (Harasewych et al., 1997; Colgan et al., 2007), and the monophyly observed here could thus be an artifact due to under-sampling within Neogastropoda. Within Conoidea, the large amount of diversity included in our dataset allows us to discuss the current classiﬁcation at genus, subfamily, and family levels. 4.2. Accuracy of taxonomic delimitations at genus level The genus is the lowest level for which we can discuss taxonomic delimitations since most of our specimens are not identiﬁed at species level. Among the 57 genera identiﬁed in our dataset, monophyly can be rejected for only two of them (Leucosyrinx and Comitas), which indicates that in most cases shell morphology is an appropriate pre-

Our analysis conﬁrms many previous assignments of genera to subfamilies as in Taylor et al. (1993) (Table 1) and subsequent reﬁnements of their classiﬁcation. We thus conﬁrm a position of Conopleura in the Drilliidae (Tippet and Tucker, 1995), of Anacithara in the Crassispirinae (Kilburn, 1994), of Turridrupa in the Turrinae (Kantor et al., 1997), of Toxicochlespira in the Mangeliinae (Sysoev and Kantor, 1990), and of Glyphostomoides in the Raphitominae (Shuto, 1983). However, several results do not conﬁrm established classiﬁcations (Tables 1 and 5). The genus Otitoma, tentatively retained by Kilburn (2004) in the Mangeliinae based on shell characters, is here found to be in the Crassispirinae. The genus Lienardia, earlier classiﬁed in the Mangeliinae, is here placed in clade 12, identiﬁed as a Clathurellinae. (Furthermore, specimens attributed to Lienardia display several types of protoconchs and Lienardia as currently understood is probably a highly polyphyletic assemblage of species, some belonging to Raphitominae—

not represented in our molecular sampling—and others to Clathurellinae—as the specimens studied here). The position of Gemmuloborsonia, assigned to the Turrinae (Sysoev and Bouchet, 1996; Medinskaya, 2002), is unresolved. 4.4. Robustness of subfamilies delimitations We found discrepancies between our phylogeny and previous classiﬁcations at the subfamily level. Thus, crassispirine genera are present in two clades (2 and 7), one of them (clade 2) containing the type genus. The polyphyly of this subfamily is supported by the existence of clade C, which includes clade 2, but excludes clade 7. Since the relationships between clade 7 and others clades within clade A are not resolved, it is unconclusive whether clade 7 must be ranked as its own subfamily or whether it must be grouped together with another existing subfamily. The subfamily Cochlespirinae as currently construed appears polyphyletic too, with four distinct clades (3, 4, 8 and 9), one of them (clade 8) containing the type genus. As for the Crassispirinae, the polyphyly of the Cochlespirinae is supported by the existence of clade C, which includes clades 3 and 4, but excludes clades 8 and 9. However, because of the limits of the resolution of the deeper nodes, it is inconclusive whether clades 3 and 4 should be allocated to the Crassispirinae or should constitute a new subfamily; the subfamily Cochlespirinae could be limited to clade 8, or could also include clade 9. In the next three cases, polyphyly is possible but not demonstrated because of a general lack of support for deeper nodes in clade B. (a) Relationships between the two highly divergent clades (clades 11 and 17) of the Mangeliinae are not resolved and our results are inconclusive on the non-monophyly of the subfamily. (b) Coninae also ends up as two distinct clades (clades 19 and 21), a result already obtained by Duda and Kohn (2005). (c) The subfamily Clathurellinae is split into seven clades (clades 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 18 and 20), but the non-monophyly of these clades is not demonstrated. With one exception, our molecular clathurelline clades correspond to intra-clathurelline ‘‘groups” deﬁned by Taylor et al. (1993), suggesting that these may warrant formal naming as tribes. The exception is clade 18 which includes on one hand the genus Typhlomangelia (placed in the ‘‘borsoniid group” by Taylor et al., 1993) and on the other hand the genera Heteroturris and Microdrillia (placed in the ‘‘tomopleurid group” by Taylor et al., 1993). 4.5. Robustness of families delimitations Finally, our results also permit a discussion of family classiﬁcation within Conoidea. Taylor et al.’s (1993) anatomical study suggested a closer relationship of Clathurellinae, Conorbinae, Mangeliinae, Oenopotinae and Raphitominae to Conus than to other members of the family Turridae s.l. and their extension of Conidae

included these turrid subfamilies. In our study, clade B, although weakly supported, corresponds to Taylor et al.’s (1993) family Conidae, thus supporting its monophyly. Our study also revealed another weakly supported deep clade (clade A) that includes genera classiﬁed by Taylor et al. (1993) in three diﬀerent families: Drilliidae, Terebridae and Turridae s.s. (consisting of Clavatulinae, Cochlespirinae, Crassispirinae, Turrinae and Zonulispirinae). Genera of the Drilliidae (clade 1) are included in clade C. This well-supported clade also contains taxa of the Turridae s.s. (Crassispirinae and Comitas), and excludes the other taxa of the Turridae s.s. Consequently, Turridae s.s. are not monophyletic. Furthermore, according to Kantor (2006), the radula of Drilliidae is not fundamentally diﬀerent from that of Turridae s.s. Within clade A, the monophyly of the Terebridae is supported but its relationships with other clades of Turridae s.s. is not resolved. The strong support obtained for clade A0 (clade A without clade 9) indicates that Terebridae are closely related to Turridae s.s. Moreover, the increase of clade support from A to A0 suggests an artifact eﬀect of clade 9 on the phylogenetic reconstruction, e.g., a long branch attraction eﬀect with the outgroups. This phenomenon could be avoided by increasing the amount of diversity included in the analysis (Bergsten, 2005). A close relationship between Terebridae and Turridae s.s. had already been suggested by Cossmann (1896), and Powell (1942, 1966), based on the resemblance of the shells of Terebridae and of the clavatuline genus Pusionella. Based on this observation and the fossil record, Powell (1966) speculated that Terebridae were derived from the Clavatulinae. Our results suggest that Turridae s.s. could be closer to Terebridae than to Conidae, but the question of whether Terebridae is included in Turridae s.s. or is its sister group still remains unresolved. 4.6. Towards a stabilized system for Conoidea The weak support of neogastropod molecular phylogenies available in literature is supposed to be the consequence of an early radiation of the group (Harasewych et al., 1997; Colgan et al., 2003, 2007). Genes used in those studies were not adequate to resolve the relationships between clades that emerged during this radiation. In our study, we used the same genes, albeit at a lower taxonomic level, but deeper nodes are not resolved either. In view of the fact that most subfamilies of Turridae s.l. were already present in the Eocene, Powell (1966) dated their divergence before the Upper Cretaceous (before 65MY). As for other animal groups (e.g., Strugnell et al., 2005; Fry et al., 2006), resolving phylogenetic relationships between those early divergences seems to require slow-evolving genes. In this perspective, nuclear coding genes, rarely used in mollusk phylogenies, could be useful to resolve early relationships within Conoidea as well as deeper relationships within gastropods.

The taxonomic sampling used here allows an estimation of molecular variability within clades at each level: several genera are included in each subfamily, several subfamilies are included in each family, and most of the families deﬁned by Taylor et al. (1993) are present. This strategy, where taxonomic sampling is hierarchically organized, is clearly required to discuss monophyly of each of those groups, and some problems are thus highlighted at each taxonomic level. However, even with a dataset of 57 genera, covering most of the previously recognized families and subfamilies of Conoidea, the present study only brings preliminary results. At genus level, these 57 genera represent only 17% of the 340 already described recent genera and it is further clear that the shell-based current taxonomic extension of many genera will not stand after molecular testing. At subfamily and family levels, although a large part of the conoidean diversity is represented in this study, the families Strictispiridae and Pseudomelatomidae, the subfamilies Zonulispirinae and Zemaciinae in Turridae s.s., the Pervicaciinae in Terebridae and the Oenopotinae in Conidae, are not part of our taxon sampling. The highly divergent clades found here in several subfamilies as previously deﬁned demonstrate the need for further research in order to better restrict the taxonomic extensions of the already known subfamilies and probably formally name new subfamilies and/or tribes. Finally, at family level, new relationships are suggested. As a remake of the Conus story, it now appears that the long recognized family Terebridae does not stand alone apart from the rest of the Conoidea, but could be the sister-group or even part of the Turridae s.s.
