This study constitutes the ﬁrst evolutionary investigation of the snake family Psammophiidae—the most widespread, most clearly deﬁned, yet perhaps the taxonomically most problematic of Africa’s familylevel snake lineages. Little is known of psammophiid evolutionary relationships, and the type genus Psammophis is one of the largest and taxonomically most complex of the African snake genera. Our aims were to reconstruct psammophiid phylogenetic relationships and to improve characterisation of species boundaries in problematic Psammophis species complexes. We used approximately 2500 bases of DNA sequence from the mitochondrial and nuclear genomes, and 114 terminals covering all psammophiid genera and incorporating approximately 75% of recognised species and subspecies. Phylogenetic reconstructions were conducted primarily in a Bayesian framework and we used the Wiens/Penkrot protocol to aid species delimitation. Rhamphiophis is diphyletic, with Rhamphiophis acutus emerging sister to Psammophylax. Consequently we transfer the three subspecies of Rhamphiophis acutus to the genus Psammophylax. The monotypic genus Dipsina is sister to Psammophis. The two species of Dromophis occupy divergent positions deeply nested within Psammophis, and we therefore relegate Dromophis to the synonymy of Psammophis. Our results allow division of the taxonomically problematic Psammophis ‘sibilans’ species complex into two monophyletic entities, provisionally named the ‘phillipsii’ and ‘subtaeniatus’ complexes. Within these two clades we found support for the status of many existing species, but not for a distinction between P.p. phillipsii and P. mossambicus. Additionally, P. cf. phillipsii occidentalis deserves species status as the sister taxon of P. brevirostris. Ó 2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.

1. Introduction Psammophiidae Bourgeois, 1968 occurs throughout Africa, the Middle East, Madagascar, southern Europe and south-central Asia, and currently includes eight genera and about 50 extant species (Table 1), of which around 30 belong to the type genus Psammophis Boie, 1825. Other genera include Dipsina Jan, 1863 (one species), Dromophis Peters, 1869 (two species), Hemirhagerrhis Boettger, 1893 (four species), Malpolon Fitzinger, 1826 (three species), Mimophis Günther, 1868 (one species), Psammophylax Fitzinger, 1843 (four species), and Rhamphiophis Peters, 1854 (ﬁve species). Monophyly of the family has been demonstrated in numerous phylogenetic studies based on immunological data (Cadle, 1994) and mitochondrial DNA sequences (Gravlund, 2001; Vidal and Hedges, 2002; Kelly et al., 2003; Nagy et al., 2003). Additionally, Psammophiidae is deﬁned by several morphological synapomorphies; primarily the vestigial nature of the male genitalia (hemipenes), which are short, thin, and devoid of the

ornamentation characteristic of the hemipenes of other snakes (Bogert, 1940; Broadley, 1983). Consequently, almost all morphological studies since the inﬂuential work of Bogert (1940) have recognised this assemblage as a natural group (Bourgeois, 1968; Dowling and Duellman, 1978; Zaher, 2000). No study, morphological or molecular, has analysed phylogenetic relationships within the Psammophiidae, and taxon sampling has been highly restricted in those studies with psammophiid representatives. Furthermore, whilst generic delimitations and the species boundaries within many genera have been reasonably stable (e.g., Broadley, 1977b; Chirio and Ineich, 1991; Broadley and Hughes, 2000), taxonomic opinion on species delimitation within Psammophis has varied widely since systematic work on the genus began in the late 1800s (Boulenger, 1896; Loveridge, 1940; Broadley, 1966, 1977a; Hughes, 1999). The most difﬁcult group taxonomically has become known as the Psammophis ‘sibilans’ species complex, a name coined for a group of taxa that have at some stage been considered synonyms or subspecies of Psammophis sibilans Linnaeus, 1758. The prevailing uncertainty in Psammophis species boundaries is widely viewed as one of the most protracted and challenging problems in African snake taxonomy, though substan-

tial progress has been made in the identiﬁcation and morphological delineation of southern African species (Broadley, 1966, 1975, 1977a, 1983, 2002). A revision of the entire genus was conducted by Brandstätter (1995), but this was generally not considered to be authoritative (Hughes, 1999; Broadley, 2002) and will not be discussed further. Our study seeks to address the poor phylogenetic understanding of Psammophiidae and the taxonomic disarray of Psammophis, and our objectives are: (1) to reconstruct the phylogeny of the Psammophiidae using an extensive taxon sample spanning the entire family; (2) to provide a provisional DNA-based hypothesis of species limits in the problematic Psammophis ‘sibilans’ complex, which can in future be tested against and integrated with other forms of data; and (3) to use these results to propose taxonomic alterations where the evidence for such change is deemed sufﬁcient. 2. Methods 2.1. Taxon sampling and laboratory protocols

P. sibilans (Broadley, 1977a), but reinspection of the specimen (by DGB) indicates that this name is probably valid. Our mitochondrial data set included sequences from the cytochrome b (Cytb, 1100 bases) and NADH dehydrogenase subunit four genes (ND4, 693 bases), and about 169 bases from three transfer RNA (tRNA) genes ﬂanking the 30 end of the ND4 gene (tRNAHis, tRNASer, tRNALeu). Our nuclear data set comprised 570 bases from the c-mos proto-oncogene. Appendix A lists all sequences used in this study. Novel DNA sequences were generated for 105 specimens (Cytb), 106 specimens (ND4 and tRNA), and 22 specimens (c-mos). Using primers published elsewhere (Cytb: L14910, de Queiroz et al., 2002; L14919, H16064, Burbrink et al., 2000. ND4: ND4, Leu, Arévalo et al., 1994. c-mos: S77, S78, Slowinski and Lawson, 2002). These new sequences were deposited in the GenBank, with accession numbers as in Appendix A. Tissue samples were in the form of liver, muscle or blood preserved in 80–96% ethanol or in 20% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and saturated sodium chloride. Whole genomic DNA was extracted and stored following the protocols of Sambrook et al. (1989) and Burbrink et al. (2000), and PCR ampliﬁcations were carried out in 25 ll volumes using Ready-To-Go PCR Beads (Amersham Biosciences). Thermocycling conditions for mtDNA ampliﬁcation included an initial denaturation step at of 5 min at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of (denaturation, 40 sec, 94 °C; annealing, 40 sec, 47 °C; extension, 1 min, 72 °C), and a ﬁnal 5 min extension phase at 72 °C. Conditions for c-mos ampliﬁcation comprised an initial denaturation of 1 min at 95 °C, 5 cycles of (30 s, 95 °C; 45 s, 48 °C; 1 min, 72 °C), 30 cycles of (30 s, 95 °C; 45 s, 54 °C; 1 min, 72 °C), and a terminal 5-min extension step at 72 °C. Fragments were isolated by electrophoresis on a 2% agarose gel and puriﬁed using a GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Puriﬁcation Kit (Amersham Biosciences) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Forward and reverse sequencing of the double stranded puriﬁed fragments was carried out in 10-ll volumes using the BigDyeÒ Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, ABI) and the following thermocycling conditions: 25 cycles of (10 s, 94 °C; 5 s, 50 °C; 4 min, 60 °C). Products were analysed on ABI3700 or ABI3730-automated DNA sequencers. 2.2. Phylogenetic methods

Our taxon set comprised 114 terminals (individual samples), including 39 of the approximately 50 recognised psammophiid species from all eight genera, ﬁve outgroup taxa from other major African snake lineages, and one outgroup from the Elapidae (Appendix A, and Table 1). Most (but not all) specimens used in this study have been seen and identiﬁed by CMRK. No recent authoritative revision of the genus Psammophis exists, and the taxonomy applied in this study follows the most recent literature dealing with subsets of the genus. Note that some Psammophis species and subspecies are very poorly delineated, and identiﬁcation of certain specimens is tentative. The specimen from Senegal (haplotype PEM1) has not been seen by any of the authors and was not conclusively identiﬁed by its collectors. On the basis of our phylogenetic results this specimen is provisionally treated as Psammophis cf. rukwae. Hughes and Wade (2004) described Psammophis phillipsii occidentalis largely in recognition of a colour variant and no DNA data are available for the types; the specimens treated here as P. cf. phillipsii occidentalis were provisionally identiﬁed (by CMRK) on the basis of potentially labile characters associated with pattern and colouration. Similarly, the Ethiopian specimens we refer to as P. cf. sibilans are so-called to reﬂect their close morphological similarity to the true P. sibilans described from Egypt; they resemble the latter in colouration and head scalation (ﬁve infralabials are typically in contact with the anterior sublinguals). There is some speculation on the validity of Psammophis sudanensis; the specimen on which the name is based (the type of Psammophis subtaeniatus var. sudanensis Werner, 1919) was formerly allocated to

2.2.1. Alignment and genetic distances Sequences were aligned using ClustalX 1.64 (Thompson et al., 1997) and manually adjusted with BioEdit 5.0.9 (Hall, 1999). DAMBE (Xia and Xie, 2001) was used to screen the aligned sequences for frame-shift mutations and premature stop codons, which may indicate the presence of pseudogenes (e.g., transpositions of mtDNA to the nuclear genome: Sorenson and Fleischer, 1996; Bensasson et al., 2001). Calculations of genetic distances within and between clades were based on Cytb and ND4 sequences. Regression of ND4 against Cytb for pairwise K2P distances (not shown) revealed a slope of 0.94, suggesting that these genes evolve at very similar rates, so data from the two genes were combined for distance calculations. We used MEGA2 (Kumar et al., 2001) with the K2P model of distance correction to calculate mean and maximum within-group divergences, and minimum between-group divergences. 2.2.2. Data combination and splitting of the data set The ILD test of data homogeneity Farris et al. (1995) has been shown to be problematic (Barker and Lutzoni, 2002), so we used PAUP* 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002) to conduct non-parametric bootstrap analyses under the MP criterion for each gene. No signiﬁcant bootstrap support for conﬂicting nodes was evident (exceeding 70%; Hillis and Bull, 1993), so we combined data from different genes for subsequent phylogenetic analyses. Since nuclear sequences were only generated for a fraction of the terminals, two overlapping data sets were created for independent analysis. The

‘mitochondrial’ data set comprised mitochondrial sequences from all 114 terminals, whilst the pruned ‘mixed’ data set included both mitochondrial and nuclear sequences from 21 ingroup and all outgroup taxa (see Appendix A). 2.2.3. Phylogenetic inference and clade support Phylogenetic analyses were conducted using parametric (maximum likelihood, ML and Bayesian inference, BI) and non-parametric (maximum parsimony, MP) approaches. For DNA sequence data, MP can be inconsistent even under simple models of cladogenesis (Huelsenbeck and Lander, 2003), so parametric methods are generally favoured. Notwithstanding recent methodological advances in the use of ML to reconstruct phylogenies (e.g. Stamatakis, 2006; Zwickl, 2006), Bayesian approaches are still able to implement more complex (and hopefully more realistic) models of sequence evolution. Consequently, we relied primarily on Bayesian methods for phylogenetic reconstruction, whilst ML and MP approaches were used to perform non-parametric bootstrap analyses (Felsenstein, 1985). In assessing the reliability of phylogenetic hypotheses, we follow the majority of recent literature in considering Bayesian posterior probability values P95% and ML and MP bootstrap proportions P70% to indicate signiﬁcant support. We used MrBayes v3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) for phylogeny reconstruction by BI and employed the rigorous model selection procedure described by Castoe et al. (2004) to identify the model of DNA substitution and data partitioning that best ﬁts each of our data sets. An outline of this procedure is provided below, but readers are referred to Castoe et al. (2004) for full methodological details. Initially, the optimal overall DNA substitution model and parameters for each data set were selected using hierarchical likelihood ratio tests (hLRTs) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), implemented in ModelTest 3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998). This ‘global’ optimal model of DNA substitution was applied in all subsequent analyses. For the mitochondrial data set (Cytb, ND4, tRNA) the tRNA genes were pooled and treated as a single tRNA partition, and three models of data partitioning were deﬁned based on sequence properties of potential biological relevance: (A) the unpartitioned data set, (B) protein-coding versus tRNA genes, and (C) Cytb, ND4 and tRNA partitioned independently. Within models B and C, a further two models (SSR, site-speciﬁc rates) were deﬁned based on the degree to which evolution of the partitions is assumed to be independent. First, partitions have the same underlying parameter values and only among-site rates (overall rates, not a rate-heterogeneity values) are allowed to vary across-partitions (SSR model). Second, all of the parameters are unlinked across partitions and are free to achieve unique optimal values in the different partitions (SSR-unlinked model). Overall, ﬁve different models were deﬁned: A, B-SSR, B-SSR-unlinked, C-SSR, and C-SSR-unlinked. These ﬁve models were analysed independently in MrBayes, applying the global optimal model of DNA substitution. For the mixed data set (Cytb, ND4, tRNA, c-mos), four models of data partitioning were deﬁned: (A) as above, (B) mitochondrial versus nuclear genes, (C) mitochondrial protein-coding versus mitochondrial tRNA versus nuclear genes, and (D) all genes partitioned independently. SSR and SSR-unlinked models were deﬁned within models B–D, to give a ﬁnal total of seven different models: A, B-SSR, B-SSR-unlinked, C-SSR, C-SSR-unlinked, D-SSR, D-SSR-unlinked. As above, these models were analysed independently in MrBayes. Bayesian analyses were conducted with ﬂat priors as per the MrBayes defaults, and with model parameters estimated as part of the procedure. Each analysis comprised two independent runs (starting from different random trees) of one cold and three incrementally heated MCMC chains, sampling the chains every 100 generations. We used the built-in convergence diagnostic (average standard deviation of split frequencies) to monitor the mixing of chains and convergence of independent runs, and we discarded as

burn-in all generations prior to this diagnostic reaching a value of 0.01. Initial analyses providing data for comparison of the different models were run for 1.4 million generations, and analyses applying the ﬁnal best-ﬁt model were run for 5 million generations. MP bootstrap analyses (1000 pseudoreplicates) were implemented using PAUP* 4.0b10, with uninformative characters excluded, alignment gaps coded as a ﬁfth state, simple sequence addition, and tree bisection–reconnection branch swapping. ML bootstrap analyses (1000 pseudoreplicates) were performed with RAxML version 7.0.0 (Stamatakis, 2006), using the closest available equivalent to the best-ﬁt model of DNA substitution and data partitioning selected for Bayesian analyses. 2.3. Detailed investigation of the Psammophis ‘sibilans’ species complex Since c-mos sequences were only generated for a minority of Psammophis terminals, the following analyses were based on mitochondrial data only. 2.3.1. Phylogenetic networks We used phylogenetic networks to visualise relationships in cases where the underlying evolutionary history of the data may not be purely hierarchical (intraspeciﬁc relationships), and also as a tool to visualise ambiguity in the data (conﬂicting phylogenetic signal). For network construction we used SplitsTree 4 (Huson and Bryant, 2004) to implement the Neighbor-Net procedure (Bryant and Moulton, 2004), which is a distance method based on the NJ algorithm. The K2P model of distance correction was used to account for multiple substitutions per site. 2.3.2. Provisional species delimitation The strongest support for species hypotheses is the concordance of conclusions from multiple operational criteria and independent data sets (e.g., Wiens and Penkrot, 2002; Morando et al., 2003; Dayrat, 2005). However, our study was limited to use of mtDNA data alone, and the species boundaries delineated here must be treated as highly provisional. Wiens and Penkrot (2002) provide an explicit tree-based species delimitation protocol (henceforth termed the WP strategy) designed for application to phylogenies of non-recombining DNA haplotypes. This approach informs species-level decisions by applying a dichotomous key to terminals currently classiﬁed as a single species (the ‘focal species’). Wiens and Penkrot suggest that their method be used in conjunction with nested clade analysis (NCA: Templeton et al., 1987, 1995; Templeton and Sing, 1993). This combined approach uses the WP strategy to delimit species at the deepest levels of divergence, then subsequent application of NCA to well-sampled clades to see whether any further splitting may be statistically justiﬁed. However, our sampling of individuals and localities within most ‘focal species’ is limited and likely to be insufﬁcient for useful application of NCA. In addition, serious concerns have been raised about the high incidence of false positive results returned by NCA (e.g. Panchal and Beaumont, 2007; Petit, 2008), and we concur with Petit (2008) that use of this method should be deferred pending thorough critical evaluation. Following Wiens and Penkrot (2002), we use the term ‘‘exclusive” in place of ‘‘monophyletic” in the context of species delimitation since true monophyly may not occur at the intraspeciﬁc level. The concept of monophyly incorporates the closely related properties of ‘‘exclusivity” and ‘‘common ancestry”, and above the species level these two properties coincide. However, reticulating relationships lead to a decoupling of these properties, and entities of exclusive common ancestry do not exist where reticulation predominates (de Queiroz and Donoghue, 1990). All species may at some stage in their history be nonexclusive for any given gene, due to incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms (Neigel and Avise, 1986). This may be especially common in situations where a widespread species

1048

C.M.R. Kelly et al. / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 47 (2008) 1045–1060

gives rise to a much more restricted species, which thus develops exclusivity more rapidly than the other (Wiens and Penkrot, 2002). The WP strategy permits discovery of non-exclusive species. 3. Results 3.1. Phylogenetic analyses 3.1.1. Alignment and genetic distances Alignment was unambiguous for all protein-coding genes, and no frame-shift mutations or premature stop codons were detected. For tRNA, eight gaps were required for preservation of homology, ranging from one to six bases in length. The mitochondrial data set comprised 1962 characters (including outgroups—1077 variable, 953 potentially parsimony-informative; excluding outgroups—979 variable, 893 potentially parsimony-informative). The mixed data set comprised 1957 mtDNA characters (including outgroups—1023 variable, 825 potentially parsimony-informative; excluding outgroups—879 variable, 685 potentially parsimonyinformative) and 570 nuclear characters (including outgroups— 111 variable, 35 potentially parsimony-informative; excluding outgroups—74 variable, 23 potentially parsimony-informative). Genetic distances within and between selected Psammophis taxa, including those in the Psammophis ‘sibilans’ complex, are presented in Table 2. 3.1.2. Model selection and Bayesian MCMC For the mitochondrial data set, TVM + I + C was selected as the global optimal model of DNA substitution. However, this model is not implemented in MrBayes so the closely related GTR + I + C model was used instead. B-SSR-unlinked was tentatively selected as the best-ﬁt model, but inspection of preliminary analyses revealed that certain parameters were not unique. Unlinking was thus reduced to allow only among-site rates and state frequencies to vary between partitions, and further testing resulted in choice of this reﬁned model (B-SSR-unlink-statefreq) as the ﬁnal model of best ﬁt. For the mixed data set, GTR + I + C was selected as the global optimal model

of DNA substitution, and B-SSR as the model of best ﬁt. In all analyses of both data sets, independent runs converged on identical consensus topologies and very similar parameter estimates, and all runs reached stationarity rapidly (usually within 50,000 generations). 3.1.3. Evolutionary relationships Figs. 1 and 2 illustrate the 50% majority-rule Bayesian consensus topologies for the mitochondrial and mixed data sets, respectively, and both data sets led to identical psammophiid phylogenetic relationships. The approximate geographic distributions of clades A–D and 1–9 are presented in Fig. 3 (Maps a–1). Figs. 1 and 2 include clade support values in the form of Bayesian posterior probabilities, ML bootstrap proportions, and MP bootstrap proportions. Support is generally high, with signiﬁcant support for 81% (BI), 90% (ML) and 74% (MP) of ingroup nodes in the mitochondrial topology, and 80% (BI), 85% (ML) and 40% (MP) of ingroup nodes in the mixed topology. There is no consistent difference between the two topologies in the support values for equivalent nodes, but two important basal nodes (marked with black circles in Figs. 1 and 2) were more strongly supported by the mixed data set than by the mitochondrial data alone. No detailed topological descriptions will be attempted here, and readers are referred to Figs. 1 and 2 for details of tree topology. At a higher level, four major lineages were deﬁned for ease of discussion, all with strong support in the mixed topology (A–D; Figs. 1 and 2). Surprisingly, Rhamphiophis acutus is placed in clade B as sister to Psammophylax, instead of grouping with its supposed congeners in clade A. In clade D the two species of Dromophis occupy divergent positions deeply nested within the genus Psammophis. Within clade D, nine distinct lineages were deﬁned for ease of discussion, based on analysis of the mitochondrial data set (1–9; Fig. 1). Results from the mixed data set (Fig. 2) are congruent with those from the mitochondrial data alone. The West and Central African Dromophis praeornatus is placed in clade 5 with Psammophis elegans, Psammophis schokari and Psammophis punctulatus, rather than with Dromophis lineatus in clade 7. Clades 8 and 9 have usually been collectively referred to as the Psammophis ‘sibilans’ complex (e.g.,

Broadley, 1983). Our results suggest that further subdivision of this complex is possible (Fig. 1), and we refer to these clades as the ‘phillipsii’ complex (clade 8) and the ‘subtaeniatus’ complex (clade 9). 3.2. Detailed investigation of the Psammophis ‘sibilans’ species complex 3.2.1. Evolutionary relationships Relationships within the ‘sibilans’ complex were investigated using phylogenetic networks in addition to the standard hierarchical phylogenetic methods. Fig. 4 illustrates the network diagram obtained using the Neighbor-Net procedure and applying the K2P model of distance correction. This is mostly congruent with the Bayesian analysis, and also supports subdivision of the ‘sibilans’ complex into clades 8 and 9. The ‘phillipsii’ complex (clade 8) contains ﬁve currently recognised taxa: P. leopardinus, P. brevirostris, P. p. phillipsii, P. cf. phillipsii occidentalis, and P. mossambicus. The primarily Central African P. cf. phillipsii occidentalis groups with the southern African P. brevirostris to form clade 8a (Figs. 1 and 4) rather than associating with typical P. p. phillipsii of West Africa, and our single representative of this latter taxon is deeply nested within the more extensive sample of P. mossambicus (clade 8b; Figs. 1 and 4). The ‘subtaeniatus’ complex (clade 9) also contains ﬁve currently recognised taxa (assuming that our P. cf. sibilans specimens from Ethiopia are correctly identiﬁed): P. cf. sibilans, P. rukwae, P. subtaeniatus, P. sudanensis, and P. orientalis. A specimen of uncertain identity from Senegal (haplotype PEM1) groups with P. rukwae with very strong support (BI = 100%, ML = 100%, MP = 98; Fig. 1), and we provisionally treat this specimen as P. cf. rukwae. 3.2.2. Provisional species delimitation Selection of ‘focal species’ for assessment with the WP strategy was largely according to current taxonomy, and the following nine

species-level hypotheses were tested (see Figs. 1 and 4). Clade 8: P. leopardinus, P. brevirostris, P. phillipsii (incorporating the two taxa phillipsii and cf. occidentalis), and P. mossambicus. Clade 9: P. cf. sibilans, P. rukwae, P. subtaeniatus, P. orientalis, and P. sudanensis. Given the current data, all but two of these ‘focal species’ are exclusive and without strongly supported early-diverging lineages concordant with geographic distribution. The exceptions are P. phillipsii and P. mossambicus, and three points can be made regarding these taxa. First, haplotypes of P. phillipsii are non-exclusive with respect to the exclusive P. brevirostris, and there is no evidence of gene ﬂow between the earliest-diverging lineages of these two groups. Second, the lone P. p. phillipsii haplotype is nested among P. mossambicus samples, rendering the latter also non-exclusive. Unfortunately only one sample of P. p. phillipsii was available, so no decisions were possible regarding gene ﬂow between the two focal species. Third, within P. mossambicus there is good support for a disjunction between the South African haplotypes (231 and TM83688) and the remaining samples (BI = 94%, ML = 82%, MP = 94%; Fig. 1), and these two earliest-diverging lineages are concordant with geographic distribution. 4. Discussion 4.1. Phylogenetic relationships and implications for taxonomy 4.1.1. The family Psammophiidae (clades A–D) The pattern of relationships retrieved at the generic level is in agreement with that obtained by Gravlund (2001), using 12S rRNA and 16S rRNA gene sequences from single representatives of ﬁve psammophiid genera. A more comprehensive psammophiid taxon sample was included in the immunological study of Cadle (1994)— ﬁve genera, and seven species of Psammophis—but the only resolved relationship at the generic level was a clade uniting Rham-

phiophis oxyrhynchus and the monotypic genus Dipsina. This conﬂicts with our results, in which Rhamphiophis rostratus (at one time a subspecies of R. oxyrhynchus) and R. rubropunctatus group with the North African and Eurasian genus Malpolon to form clade A. Recent taxonomic work on Malpolon has been undertaken by Carranza et al. (2006) and Geniez et al. (2006). Dipsina multimaculata resembles Rhamphiophis morphologically and was for a long time classiﬁed as a species of the latter genus, but on the basis of differing cranial osteology, Broadley (1983) resurrected the genus Dipsina Jan, 1863. He considered both Rhamphiophis and Dipsina to be derived from ‘‘ancestral Psammophylax stock” (Broadley, 1983), but our study instead provides good support for a sister relationship between Dipsina (clade C) and Psammophis (clade D). In clade B, the strong support for a sister relationship between Psammophylax and R. acutus renders the genus Rhamphiophis diphyletic. Broadley (1971) provides a review and taxonomic history of R. acutus, noting that in several respects (dentition and colouration) this taxon forms a link between Rhamphiophis and Psammophylax. The most distinctive synapomorphy of Rhamphiophis is its shortened and reinforced skull (adaptations for digging), a characteristic that is less pronounced in R. acutus (Broadley, 1971; Chirio and Ineich, 1991). It is clear that this character is homoplasious, and we transfer the three subspecies of R. acutus to the genus Psammophylax, i.e. Psammophylax acutus acutus (Günther, 1888) (comb. nov.), Psammophylax acutus jappi (Broadley, 1971) (comb. nov.) and Psammophylax acutus togoensis (Matschie,

1893) (comb. nov.). This change increases the dental variation in Psammophylax and necessitates the following modiﬁcation to the diagnosis provided by Broadley (1977b): ‘The maxilla bears 9–13 subequal teeth, separated by a diastema from two enlarged grooved fangs on the posterior end of the bone; palatine teeth 7– 11; pterygoid 9–23; dentary 15–24.’ In Hemirhagerrhis, the southwestern African semi-desert species H. viperina is sister to an East African clade comprising H. hildebrandtii and H. kelleri. Broadley and Hughes (2000) undertook a morphological revision of the genus and proposed an evolutionary hypothesis that implied a closer relationship between H. viperina and H. hildebrandtii than between the latter and H. kelleri. Our results contradict this hypothesis, but a complete picture of Hemirhagerrhis relationships awaits inclusion of the widespread H. nototaenia. There is substantial well-supported phylogenetic structure in Mimophis, suggesting the presence of taxonomically unrecognised genetic diversity, and further work is necessary to investigate this. Dromophis praeornatus and Dromophis lineatus occupy divergent and well-supported positions nested deeply within Psammophis, in clades 5 and 7 respectively (Fig. 1). We therefore relegate the genus Dromophis to the synonymy of Psammophis, forming Psammophis praeornatus (Schlegel, 1837) (comb. nov) and Psammophis lineatus (Dumèril & Bibron, 1854) (comb. nov.). Loveridge (1940) provides a taxonomic revision of both of these genera stating, ‘‘Dromophis has been included in this paper with the purpose of inviting attention to its close relationship to Psammophis sibilans as evidenced by

C.M.R. Kelly et al. / Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution 47 (2008) 1045–1060

1053

its synonymy, and the references to P. sibilans which should properly be referred to as D. lineatus.” More recently, Hughes (2004) has also noted the high incidence of misidentiﬁcation of D. lineatus as one of several taxa from the Psammophis ‘sibilans’ species complex. Indeed, our results show a sister relationship between D. lineatus (clade 7; Fig. 1) and the ‘sibilans’ complex (clades 8 and 9; Fig. 1). The main character formerly used to separate Dromophis and Psammophis involves maxillary dentition - in Psammophis (but not in Dromophis) a pair of enlarged fang-like teeth is present anterior to the fangs, separated from other maxillary dentition by an interspace on each side (Loveridge, 1940; Broadley, 1983). The generic diagnosis provided for Psammophis by Broadley (1983) should thus be modiﬁed as follows: ‘Maxillary teeth usually 10–16, 3–5 small teeth anteriorly, followed after a distinct interspace by two much enlarged recurved and fang-like teeth (below anterior border of eye), which are followed, after a second interspace, by 3–7 small teeth and then two strongly enlarged grooved fangs (below the posterior border of the eye). In P. praeornatus and P. lineatus (formerly assigned to the genus Dromophis) there is a continuous series of 10–16 small teeth (median longest) preceding the large grooved fangs below the posterior border of the eye. Anterior mandibular teeth strongly enlarged.’ 4.1.2. The genus Psammophis (clades 1–9) The only phylogenetic analysis incorporating several Psammophis taxa is the immunological study of Cadle (1994), which included the species biseriatus, condanarus, elegans, phillipsii (subspecies unknown), punctulatus (subspecies unknown), rukwae, and subtaeniatus. The resultant topology (Cadle’s Fig. 3) showed P. condanarus sister to a polychotomy containing biseriatus, elegans, punctulatus, and a phillipsii + rukwae + subtaeniatus clade. This is congruent with our results. We deﬁned nine lineages in the genus (Fig. 1) and a high proportion of nodes had signiﬁcant support. The following points are noteworthy. (1) The southern African Psammophis crucifer (clade 1) and the two exclusively Eurasian taxa (clade 2: P. condanarus and P. lineolatus) are the earliest-diverging lineages. The juxtaposition of these geographically distantly separated taxa raises interesting biogeographic questions. (2) Five southern African taxa are included in clade 3 and, with the exception of P. trigrammus, all were considered by Broadley (1977a) to be related and were later referred to as the ‘‘Psammophis notostictus complex” (Broadley, 2002). Broadley (1977a, 2002) treated P. trigrammus as a member of the ‘‘Afro-Asian P. schokari group”, but our results indicate that it is the earliest-diverging lineage in the Psammophis notostictus group. Within this clade, three subspecies of Psammophis leightoni were recognised by Broadley (1975)—leightoni, trinasalis and namibensis—all of which were subsequently elevated to species status (Broadley, 2002). We were only able to include single representatives of P. leightoni and P. namibensis, and their low K2P distance (0.39%; Table 2) would suggest intra- rather than interspeciﬁc divergence. Further molecular work on the P. leightoni complex is necessary on a broad geographic scale to investigate the existence and limits of putative species boundaries in the group. (3) Psammophis angolensis (clade 4) is a widespread species with several peculiar autapomorphies, including small size, reduced number of teeth, and a substantial reduction in the number of dorsal scale rows. It was originally described under the generic name Amphiophis Bocage, 1872, and Brandstätter (1995) suggested that this be revived as a monotypic subgenus. However our phylogenies place it squarely in the genus Psammophis. (4) Clade 5 includes Psammophis schokari (subspecies uncertain, probably schokari), P. punctulatus trivirgatus, P. elegans, and Dromophis (now Psammophis) praeornatus. It is likely that P. schokari aegyptius and P. punctulatus trivirgatus both represent valid species

(aegyptius: Schleich et al., 1996; Rato et al., 2007. trivirgatus: Lanza, 1990; Hughes, 1999), but our data were insufﬁcient to address these issues. Broadley (1977a, 2002) included the species schokari, aegyptius, punctulatus, elegans and trigrammus in the ‘‘Psammophis schokari group”. With the exception of P. trigrammus (placed in clade 3), and with the addition of P. praeornatus, our results agree with Broadley’s morphological assessment. (5) The distinction between Psammophis biseriatus and Psammophis tanganicus (clade 6) was ﬁrst appreciated by Loveridge (1940), who described tanganicus as a subspecies of P. biseriatus on the basis of scalation differences. Bezy and Drewes (1985) conﬁrmed and reinforced these distinctions and discovered that the two forms were sympatric at several sites, so elevated them to species level. Subsequently Largen and Rasmussen (1993) analysed a large sample of specimens from Ethiopia and northern Somalia and found higher degrees of morphological overlap than in the earlier studies. The minimum mitochondrial K2P distance between these taxa was 11.38% (Table 2) and our phylogenetic results support their reciprocal monophyly, providing further evidence for their status as separate species. The remainder of Psammophis diversity resides in the ‘sibilans’ complex. The following discussion is centred on the two subdivisions of this problematic clade: the ‘phillipsii’ complex (clade 8) and the ‘subtaeniatus’ complex (clade 9). 4.1.3. Species delimitation in the Psammophis ‘sibilans’ complex (clades 8–9) The use of mitochondrial DNA data in delineation of species boundaries is common (e.g., Puorto et al., 2001; Wiens and Penkrot, 2002; Hebert et al., 2004; Roe and Sperling, 2007), and mtDNA has an important advantage for species delimitation compared with nuclear markers (e.g., nuclear DNA and morphology): its smaller effective population size will cause alleles to coalesce approximately four times more recently than in the latter. Thus, species should become distinct in their mtDNA haplotype phylogenies well before this is evident in phylogenies from nuclear data. Mitochondrial gene trees are able to span the interface between intraspeciﬁc and interspeciﬁc evolution, and are consequently powerful tools that can be used to investigate and delimit the boundaries between species (Templeton, 2001). However, there are also several limitations of mtDNA for inference of species boundaries. It is becoming increasingly evident that ecological selection can produce a reduction in gene ﬂow across habitat boundaries, potentially leading to reproductive isolation (ecotonal speciation: Smith et al., 1997; Thorpe and Richard, 2001; Ogden and Thorpe, 2002). In some cases, ecological selection may be more important than historical vicariance in causing reproductive isolation (e.g., Thorpe and Richard, 2001), and in these cases real species boundaries may be very different from patterns of historical vicariance inferred using mtDNA. Other limitations of mtDNA for species delimitation include: (1) retention of ancestral polymorphism; (2) sensitivity to sexual biases in dispersal and gene ﬂow; (3) inheritance of the entire mitochondrial genome as a single linkage unit; (4) introgression; and (5) paralogy resulting from transpositions of mtDNA to the nuclear genome (e.g., Moritz and Cicero, 2004). There is insufﬁcient research on the Psammophiidae to determine whether sexually biased dispersal may be an issue. Hybridization appears to be rare, and every effort was made in this study to avoid comparison of paralogous sequences. We have based our investigation of species limits on mtDNA data alone but it is clear that species hypotheses proposed on this basis should be tested against independent data sets, so the species boundaries delineated here must be viewed as provisional. A further caveat concerns the small sample sizes for most of the focal species tested. Identiﬁcation of species boundaries requires accurate characterisa-

tion of intraspeciﬁc diversity, and this can only be based on small samples if these samples extend across population subdivisions as indicated by geography and phenotypic variation (Moritz and Cicero, 2004; Roe and Sperling, 2007). Our sample of P. mossambicus was fairly comprehensive, and geographic coverage was reasonable for P. orientalis and P. rukwae. However for the other taxa, data were unavailable from large sectors of their geographic ranges. Noting these limitations, our results allow the following provisional conclusions. The ‘phillipsii’ complex (clade 8) contains four focal species: P. leopardinus, P. brevirostris, P. phillipsii (including the subspecies phillipsii and occidentalis), and P. mossambicus, all of which have complex taxonomic histories. The ﬁrst two taxa were formerly regarded as subspecies of P. sibilans (e.g., Broadley, 1977a), but both were elevated to species status by Broadley (2002). The original description of P. phillipsii (Hallowell, 1844) was based on specimens from Liberia, and Broadley (1977a, 1983) treated this as a widespread species ranging from Senegal to South Africa. Subsequently, Brandstätter (1995) and Hughes (1999) considered P. phillipsii to be restricted to West Africa, and Branch (1998) was the ﬁrst to use the name P. mossambicus Peters, 1882 to refer to the former southern and East African populations of P. phillipsii. This name is now in common usage. Psammophis phillipsii occidentalis (Werner, 1919) was initially described as a colour variant of P. sibilans, and Hughes and Wade (2004) resurrected it as a subspecies of P. phillipsii. Our analyses provide support for the species status of P. leopardinus and P. brevirostris, but results for the other two taxa require a different interpretation. The three samples of P. cf. phillipsii occidentalis form a clade sister to P. brevirostris, and application of the WP strategy indicates that this clade represents a species-level taxon. As already noted, the identiﬁcation of our P. cf. p. occidentalis specimens was based on potentially labile characters associated with pattern and colouration, and is thus somewhat uncertain. Further, all of these specimens were collected outside the known distribution range of P. p. occidentalis, so we refer to these specimens as P. cf. occidentalis. On the basis of morphological similarities, we predict that Psammophis zambiensis probably belongs in clade 8a with P. brevirostris and P. cf. occidentalis. The single P. p. phillipsii sample is nested among haplotypes of P. mossambicus in clade 8b, but since only one sample of the former was available, no decisions were possible regarding gene ﬂow between the two focal species. A primary feature supposedly distinguishing P. p. phillipsii from P. mossambicus (and from all other West African Psammophis species) is the state of the cloacal scale: entire (CSE) in P. p. phillipsii and divided (CSD) in the others. However, Hughes and Wade (2004) note a marked east–west cline in this character in West Africa (high proportion of CSD in the east and high CSE in the west), and the two forms are often found in sympatry. Luiselli et al. (2004) could ﬁnd no ecological differences between sympatric CSE and CSD specimens in southern Nigeria. We tentatively interpret the balance of evidence as indicating that P. p. phillipsii and P. mossambicus are conspeciﬁc, and hereafter we refer to clade 8b as P. phillipsii. Note that within this clade there is good support for a disjunction between the South African haplotypes (231 and TM83688) and the remaining samples, and these earliest-diverging lineages are concordant with geographic distribution. It is thus possible that future work could show these South African populations to represent a distinct species. The ‘subtaeniatus’ complex (clade 9) contains ﬁve focal species: P. cf. sibilans (Ethiopian), P. rukwae, P. subtaeniatus, P. sudanensis, and P. orientalis. Largen and Rasmussen (1993) examined a large sample of Ethiopian Psammophis cf. sibilans and found the vast majority to agree with typical Egyptian P. sibilans in their infralabial arrangement. Broadley (1966) described Psammophis rukwae

(from southwest Tanzania) as a subspecies of P. sibilans, and subsequently elevated it to species status (Broadley, 1977a). Psammophis subtaeniatus Peters, 1882 was described from Mozambique, and P. sudanensis and P. orientalis have at various times both been considered subspecies of this taxon. Psammophis subtaeniatus var. sudanensis Werner, 1919 was described from the southern Sudan and treated as a subspecies of P. subtaeniatus by Loveridge (1940) and Broadley (1966). Later Broadley (1977a) considered the type to be referable to P. sibilans, but reinspection of the specimen (by DGB) indicates that P. sudanensis is probably a valid name. Psammophis orientalis was described as an eastern subspecies of P. subtaeniatus by Broadley (1977a), and later elevated to species status on the basis of sympatry with P. s. subtaeniatus in southern Zimbabwe. The WP strategy provides support for the status of all focal species in the ‘subtaeniatus’ complex. The unusually high intraspeciﬁc divergences in the rukwae and orientalis clades (Table 2) were in both cases due largely to single divergent haplotypes (P. cf. rukwae (PEM1) in the former and 177 in the latter), though in P. rukwae many distances involving other haplotypes were also relatively high (above 5%). The elevated divergence of PEM1 (from Senegal) is perhaps unsurprising given its geographic separation of over 5700 km from its nearest neighbour in our taxon sample. We consider the inclusion of this sample in the P. rukwae clade to support claims by Broadley (1977a), subsequently followed by others (Böhme, 1978, 1986; Joger, 1981; Böhme and Schneider, 1987), that this taxon occurs in West Africa. However, the high levels of mitochondrial divergence within P. rukwae and P. orientalis suggest the presence of taxonomically unrecognised diversity, and additional sampling will be necessary to further investigate species boundaries in these two clades.
